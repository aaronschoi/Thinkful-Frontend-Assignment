                    Hello, my name is <strong>Aaron Choi</strong>. I am located in Las Vegas, Nevada. I am a lover of nature and technology. I prefer to spend my time creating aquariums, gardening, or fiddling with something on the computer. I used to work in a pool hall and also a clinic for children affected by Autism. Working at these places has brought me to love and respect a myriad of people. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I am pretty easy to get along with. I empathize with other introverts, and provide a balance for high energy extroverts. I believe that money is necessary, but it should never be the one in the driver's seat.

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a denizen of the web. I use web content for news, general knowledge, entertainment, cooking, and gaming. That being said, I also love working in teams. At my two previous jobs, team work was absolutely necessary to maintain professional standards of care and management. At each location, I became the "tech-guy" -- the improptu IT on staff, but I was happy to do it. Coding will give me an opportunity to be in a team of "tech-guys (and gals)".
            </p>
            <p>
                Honestly it excites me thinking about the amount of good that can be done with a team of great programmers. My eventual goal is start on open source program that works as an AAC program so that families that are struggling to make ends meet as they are can have a free resource if they have loved ones that are unable to speak because of a disability.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love the tranquility of nature. Every sensation that the natural systems all around us provide are simply sublime to me. This is the primary reason I enjoy horticulture and creating elaborate aquariums. These give me the opportunity to bring the constant sounds and stillness of the untouched world into my home.
            </p>
            <p>
                With that, I can provide any team, a figure of patience and gratitude. I am honest while being cognizant of how I am presenting my opinions. I am always willing to work something out even if it takes a deep dive into research. Aside from my soft skills, I bring hard coding skills in javascript, html, css, and node.js.
